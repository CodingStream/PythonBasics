#This class will demonstartae the basics of pythons syntax for variavles and
#types.

name = 'Bob' #String '' or "" will do, not both
name = 'sadas'
name = 1234 # int
name = False # boolean. Note booleans must start with a capitil e.g True/False
name = 7.32 # floats

#Python allows you to change the types stored in a variable

name = None # This is similar to Null like in Java, C#, etc.

# Using type will return variable type
print(type(name))
